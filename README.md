# Multi-step Form
This repository contains a mockup of a multi-step form built using React and Vite. The form is designed to allow users to progress through a sequence of steps, review and update their selections. Users can view a summary of their choices on the final step and confirm their order. Additionally, the interface is optimized for various screen sizes, and it includes hover and focus states for interactive elements. Form validation messages are provided for missing fields, incorrect email formatting, and when a step is submitted without making a selection.
